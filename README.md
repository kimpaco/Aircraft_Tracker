# Aircraft_Tracker

DESCRIPTION: This is a fetching from an API excercise. I used a publicly available API that provides real time air traffic information, this info is fed into a script that uses a mapping API to display the location of the aircraft.

HOW TO RUN: 
1. Simply copy the content of this repository into a folder of your choosing, while maintaining the file structure. 
2. Drag and drop the index.html onto your browser.
3. The aircraft ID is randomly selected and the location will be refreshed every 25 seconds.

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
The next version will allow you to select which aircraft to track by providing the ID.

LICENSE:
This is an excercise from the MIT Full Stack Development Course.
This code was done by Francisco Robles (myself) and I allow for it to be copied or forked onto you own repository for academic purposes.
The mapping API was provided by mapbox.
The air traffic API is provided by Sergey from airlabs.
